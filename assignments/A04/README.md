### Description:
Read the following list of suggestions from chat gpt, subsequently edited and added to by me, so we can choose a direction in to take this class. Prepare a 1-2 paragraph synopsis of your plan if you had to teach this course. The basic questions are: Does Griffin just help us all connect to UvA online judge? Do we use another existing platform instead? Do we build .... I'm not sure what I want to ask. Lets talk in class.

I would say lets keep it simple and do what we were doing with UVA Online Judge. So just find equivalent options to UVA OnlineJudge problems in LeetCode and solve those. We could just keep it simple, also in class we could just go over some beneficial problems that may help with the interview process (the most common interview problems).
