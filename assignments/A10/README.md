## P451 - Sort Characters By Frequency
### Delton Hughes
### Description:
You are given an array of integers distance.

You start at the point (0, 0) on an X-Y plane, and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return true if your path crosses itself or false if it does not.

### Input Examples: 
Example 1:
<img src="/4883-Prog-Tech/profile_images/example1.png" width="200" />
    Input: distance = [2,1,1,2]
    Output: true
    Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 1).    
Example 2: 
<img src="/4883-Prog-Tech/profile_images/example2.png" width="200" />
    Input: distance = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The path does not cross itself at any point.
Example 3: 
<img src="/4883-Prog-Tech/profile_images/example3.png" width="200" />
    Input: distance = [1,1,1,2,1]
    Output: true
    Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 0).

Constraints:
- 1 <= distance.length <= 105
- 1 <= distance[i] <= 105
